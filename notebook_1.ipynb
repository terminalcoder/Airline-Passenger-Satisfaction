    "Accurding to the written down stuff about the data provided with the data, some of the columns contain subjective information provided by consumers surveyed about their past experiences. Such information may not be available when predicting overall satisfaction prior to a customer's survey response & should therefore be excluded from any model employed to predict a rating in order to bribe a customer at high risk of dissatisfaction in order to change his/her mind. (If the point of a model is too know who will be dissatisfied, in order to take measures to preemptively bribe them, we can't use as of yet unprovided ratings on 'food & drink service' to predict that info. A solution to this can be to request ratings for different elements of consumer experience as the service is provided. i.e. customers are asked to rate ease-of-online booking service immediately upon completion of booking, not as part of an overall survey.)"
